# Just a simple blog for my thoughts and ideas

## Why?

Firstly I wanted to have a place to write down my thoughts and ideas as well
as to share them with others. Secondly I wanted to have a place to experiment
with different technologies and tools. Since I'm mostly a backend developer I
wanted to get more experience with frontend technologies and tools.

## What?

I decided to go with Next.js for this blog. I know it's not the most obvious
choice for a small, simple blog, but I wanted to experiment a bit and have more
flexibility while building it. Plus, I wanted the blog to be SEO-friendly,
perform well, and feel fast and responsive. SSG (Static Site Generation) seemed
like the best fit for those needs, making it easy to maintain and deploy to
GitHub Pages.

I also set up continuous deployment with GitHub Actions, so every time I push
to the `master` branch, the blog is automatically built and deployed to GitHub
Pages.
