- [Dotfiles](https://github.com/MarkSeliverstov/.dotfiles)

Everytime I set up a new [Mac]hine, I spend a lot of time (up to 1 day)
configuring it. I decided to automate this process and make it easier for me to
set up my development environment. And it definitely worked! Now I can set up
my Mac in less than 10 minutes.

## Introduction 

2 years ago I started using [neovim](https://neovim.io/) as my main editor and
I wanted to have a way to keep my configuration files in sync as I often switch
between different machines. Since then I've just created a [git
repository](https://github.com/MarkSeliverstov/nvim) with my configuration.
It's been working fine, when I need to set up a new machine I just clone the
repository to `~/.config/nvim` (I'm using unix-like os) and I'm good to go with
all my plugins and settings.

### I'm too lazy for this

Over time, I started using more CLI tools, and my dotfiles collection kept
growing. Each tool had its own configuration files that I wanted to keep in
sync, which became a bit of a pain. Managing and installing everything on a new
machine wasnâ€™t difficult, but it was definitely time-consuming. I had to find
and install each tool, then manually copy over the configuration files to the
right locations. The last time I set up a new machine from scratch, it ended up
taking me a few hours to get everything in place... So, probably it was time to
automate this process.

In this post, I'll share how I manage my dotfiles and give you some tips on how
to do it better. Also, you can check out [what tools I use in my daily work].

## Dotfiles management

#### **1. Dotfiles repository**

First of all, you need to create a git repository to store your dotfiles. It
will help you to keep track of changes and easily sync them across different
machines.

#### **2. Symlinks**

The idea is to create symlinks from the dotfiles in your repository to the
actual files in your home directory. This way, you can keep all your
configuration files in one place and easily sync them across different
machines.

> **Example**: Let's say you have a `.zshrc` file in your dotfiles repository. To
create a symlink to this file in your home directory, you can run the following
command:
>
>```bash
>ln -s ~/<path_to_your_dotfiles>/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
>```
>
>It will create a symlink from `~/.zshrc` to `~/<path_to_your_dotfiles>/.zshrc`.
Any changes you make to the `.zshrc` file in your dotfiles repository will be
reflected in the symlinked file in your home directory.

**Hooray, you no longer need to manually copy over configuration files every time
you set up or change something!**

#### **3. Brewfile**

If you're using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on MacOS, you can create a
`Brewfile` to list all the packages you want to install. This way, you can
easily install all the necessary tools with a single command.

> **Example**: Here's an example `Brewfile` that lists some of the tools I use:
>```ruby
>...
># Basic
>brew "git"
>brew "gh"
>brew "wget"
>brew "tree"
>brew "bat"
># CLI tools
>brew "tmux"
>brew "lazydocker"
>brew "lazygit"
>brew "neovim"
>brew "fzf"
>brew "ripgrep"
>...
>```

To install all the packages listed in the `Brewfile`, you can run the following
command:
```bash
brew bundle install --file=Brewfile
```

#### **4. Installation script**

This is where the magic happens. You can create an installation script that
automates the process of setting up your development environment. The script
should install all the necessary tools and create symlinks for your dotfiles.

**Example**: Here's a simple installation script that installs (symlinks) all
my dotfiles:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define what dotfiles to link
DOTFILES_TO_LINK=(
    bin
    .config
    .tmux
    .tmux.conf
    .zshrc
    .hushlogin
    .gitconfig
    .gitignore_global
)

# Links each file from the dotfiles repository to the home directory
link_file () {
    local src=$1 dst=$2
    base_dst=$(basename "$dst")

    if [ -e "$dst" ]; then
        if ask_user "$HOME/$base_dst already exists in your system. Overwrite it? [y/n]"; then
            rm -rf "$dst"
        else
            info "skipped $base_dst"
            return
        fi
    fi

    ln -sf "$src" "$dst"
    success "linked $base_dst"
}

# Install dotfiles
install_dotfiles () {
    if ! ask_user "Do you want to link dotfiles? [y/n]"; then
        info "skipped linking dotfiles"
        return
    fi
    info "Linking dotiles"
    for file in "${DOTFILES_TO_LINK[@]}"; do
        link_file "$DOTFILES_ROOT/$file" "$HOME/$file"
    done
    success "dotfiles linked"
}
```

This is only a part of my installation script. I have also other things:

- Installation MacOS applications using [brew](https://brew.sh/) 
- Installation of MacOS settings
- Installation of zsh and oh-my-zsh with plugins
- Installation other tools like tmux, fzf, etc.

You can check out the full scripts in my [dotfiles
repository](https://github.com/MarkSeliverstov/.dotfiles) (`/scripts` folder).

## Conclusion

I spent a lot of time setting up my development environment. I like to explore
new tools and configurations, and I am really glad that I have found a way to
automate this process!
