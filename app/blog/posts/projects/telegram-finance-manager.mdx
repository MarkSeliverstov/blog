TFM is a Telegram bot that helps you manage your finances. The main feature is
to convert your voice messages into transactions using [OpenAI's Speech-to-Text
API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text).

## Why?

Today, almost every bank offers its own mobile application for managing
finances , but these apps arenâ€™t always user-friendly, especially when it comes
to viewing statistics or analyzing your expenses. I wanted to create a simple,
convenient tool for managing finances, accessible directly through a messaging
platform. Using AI to convert voice messages into text is a fantastic way to
streamline the process - for example, you can simply say, "I spent 10 dollars
on coffee," and the bot will understand and process it.

## What?

You say something like *"I spent 10 dollars on coffee"* and the bot will process
this command and update your financial records accordingly - deducting 10
dollars from your balance and adding a description (e.g., "coffee") to your
transactions. The bot can also provide you with a summary of your account.

The bot can handle multiple users, so you don't need to run your own instance.

PS. Currently, the bot is in the early stages of development, and actually I
don't have a lot of time to work on it, but I hope to add more features in the
future.

## How?

Initially, I decided it would be great to use [Google
Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/products/sheets/) as a database for
storing financial records. This approach allows users to easily analyze and
manipulate their data as they see fit. However, this requires the bot to access
the [Google Sheets
API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts), which is
slightly more complex than using a traditional database. As a result, each user
needs their own instance of the bot, along with a personal Google Service
Account.

Later, I decided to switch to a more traditional database, for allowing
multiple users to use the bot without the need for a personal instance.

The bot is built using Python and the [aiogram](https://aiogram.dev/) library.
It uses OpenAI's Speech-to-Text API to convert voice messages into text. For
the database, I chose PostgreSQL.
