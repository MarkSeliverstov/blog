[Decorators (PEP-318)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0318/) are a way to modify
or extend the behavior of functions or methods without changing their code.
Decorators are a powerful feature of Python, but they can be a bit tricky to
type correctly.

## Untyped simple example

Let's start with an untyped example of a decorator. Here's a simple decorator
that prints a message before and after calling a function:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

say_hello("BOB")
# Output:
# Something is happening before the function is called.
# Hello, BOB!
# Something is happening after the function is called.
```

>To define types, it's important to understand what `*args` and `**kwargs` are.
They are used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function.
>- `*args` is used to pass a **non-keyworded (positional)** argument list
>- `**kwargs` is used to pass a **keyworded (name=value)** argument list

## Let's type the decorator

- [declaring decorators (docs)](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generics.html#declaring-decorators) - useful information about typing decorators.
- [generics (docs)](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generics.html#generics) - pretty useful thing to know.

```python
from typing import Callable, ParamSpec, TypeVar

P = ParamSpec('P') # Used to define a generic parameter list
T = TypeVar('T') # Used to define a generic return type

def my_decorator(func: Callable[P, T]) -> Callable[P, T]:
    def wrapper(*args: P.args, **kwargs: P.kwargs) -> T:
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return result
    return wrapper
```
> **Note**: `P.args` and `P.kwargs` are used to access the positional and
> keyword arguments of the generic parameter list.\
> Also, `Callable[P, T]` is used to define a type alias for a callable with
> generic parameters.

It is pretty simple, right? We just need to define the generic parameter list
`P` and the generic return type `T`. After it we can use them to type the
`func` and `wrapper` functions.

## More complex example

What if we want to use the decorator with a class asynchronyous method
using inner properties (like `self`)?
For example, we want to measure the time of the method execution and send it
to smth like Prometheus. It's looks more complicated, right?

```python
import asyncio
import time

def decorator(func):
    async def async_wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        # How we can send metrics here if we don't have access to the class properties?
        #????.send_metrics.observe(time.time() - start)
        return result
    return async_wrapper

class Sender:
    def observe(self, time: float):
        """ Mock method to send metrics """
        pass

class App:
    send_metrics: Sender = Sender()

    @decorator
    async def async_method(self, name: str) -> str:
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

**Questions to think about**:

- How can we pass calling class to the decorator to have access to its properties?
- How can we type the async method in this case?

## Typing the more complex example

So, for the first question, we can just pass the class `App` as an argument to
the `async_wrapper`(Or we can use `/` ([PEP-570](https://peps.python.org/pep-0570/))
to enforce positional-only arguments in more complex cases).

```python
def decorator(func):
    async def async_wrapper(app, *args, **kwargs) -> str:
        start = time.time()
        result = await method(*args, **kwargs)
        app.send_metrics.observe(time.time() - start)
        return result
    return async_wrapper
```

But what about typing?

```python
from typing import Awaitable, Callable, Concatenate, ParamSpec, TypeVar

P = ParamSpec("P")
T = TypeVar("T")
FUNC_T = Callable[Concatenate["App", P], Awaitable[T]]


def decorator(func: FUNC_T[P, T]) -> FUNC_T[P, T]:
    async def async_wrapper(app: "App", *args: P.args, **kwargs: P.kwargs) -> T:
        start: float = time.time()
        result: T = await func(app, *args, **kwargs)
        app.send_metrics.observe(time.time() - start)
        return result
    return async_wrapper
```

Now we have a fully typed decorator that can be used with async methods in
classes.

- `async def async_wrapper(self: "App", *args: P.args, **kwargs: P.kwargs)
  -> T:` - typing `app` as `App` class.
- `Concatenate["App", P]` - used to concatenate the class and the generic
  parameter list. So, it means that the first argument of the async method is
  the class itself.
- `FUNC_T[P, T]` - used to define a type alias for a callable with generic
  parameters.

## Conclusion

Decorators are a powerful feature of Python, but sometimes they can be tricky
to type correctly. I hope this article helped you understand how to type this
hell ðŸ™‚.
