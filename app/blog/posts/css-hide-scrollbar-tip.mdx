Here's a quick tip on how to hide this uqly and distracting scroll bar in CSS!

```css
/* Hide scrollbar for Chrome, Safari and Opera */
.element::-webkit-scrollbar {
  display: none;
}

/* Hide scrollbar for IE, Edge and Firefox */
.element {
  -ms-overflow-style: none;  /* IE and Edge */
  scrollbar-width: none;  /* Firefox */
}
```

That's it! Now you can enjoy a clean and minimalistic design without the
scrollbar getting in the way.

PS: you can change `.element` to any other class or id you want to hide the
scrollbar for (usually I use `body` or `html`).
